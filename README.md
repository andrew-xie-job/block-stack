# block-stack,
this is a solution for a given problem: 

Given n blocks where the dimensions of the i

th block is blocks[i] = [widthi, lengthi,

heighti] (0-indexed). Choose a subset of blocks and place them on each other.
You can place block i on block j if widthi <= widthj and lengthi <=
lengthj and heighti <= heightj. You can rearrange any blocks's dimensions by rotating it to
put it on another block.
Return the maximum height of the stacked blocks.
